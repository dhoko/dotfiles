This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing Yii framework development.

## Installation ##

### With Package Control ###

If you have the [Package Control][package_control] package installed, you can install Yii framework Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for Yii framework Snippets.

### Without Package Control ###

If you haven't got Package Control installed you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder, like so:

    git clone https://github.com/dexnode/sublime-yii-snippets.git yii-snippets


[sublime]: http://www.sublimetext.com/
[package_control]: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

If you find error or think that some snippets would be better without php tags or etc.., send me a github message.
