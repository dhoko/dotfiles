The updated LiveStyle package contains many bugfixes 
and improvements, but also depends on most recent 
version of LiveStyle for Chrome extension.

Make sure your LiveStyle for Chrome version is at least 0.8.0.816,
otherwise current package will not work at all.

If you experience any issues, please help me to debug them:

1. Go to https://github.com/emmetio/livestyle-sublime/issues 
   and create a new issue with your problem description
2. It is important to add *full* console log. You can find it via
   `View > Show Console` menu item
3. If you are experienced ST user and everything seems to be fine
   in console log, you can enable debug mode for LiveStyle: go to 
   `Preferences > Package Settings > Emmet LiveStyle > Settings - User`,
   add `{"debug": true}` there and save the file.
   You must restart editor to apply changes.
