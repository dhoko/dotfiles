This Zen Coding plugin is outdated and will never receive
any updates in future. In two weeks the repo will be unpublished.

Consider switching to Emmet -- a re-branded Zen Coding project 
packed with new awesome features:

* Dynamic CSS abbreviations, automatic vendor prefixes and gradient generator.
* Better Tab key handler.
* "Lorem Ipsum" generator.
* Implicit tag names.
* JavaScript extensions support.
* New ^ operator.
* Various fixes and improvements.

The new plugin is available in Package Control: just run 
"Install Package" command and install "Emmet" plugin. Please remove 
or disable current Zen Coding plugin in order to make things work right. 

Extensive documentation about all Emmet features is available at http://docs.emmet.io
