# Nexus Theme

Dark custom UI theme for Sublime Text 2.

## Design

![Nexus theme](https://github.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme/raw/master/nexus-theme.png)

This theme is based on [nilium (Noel Cower) Nil Theme](https://github.com/nilium/st2-nil-theme) and he based his on the following:

>[Raik Ilves's Pseudo OSX
theme](https://github.com/raik/st2-pseudo-osx-theme), which is in turn
based on [Ian Hill's Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-
theme).  Additionally, this theme was inspired by [Liam Cain's Refresh
theme](https://github.com/BoundInCode/st2-refresh-theme), which is also
a variant of Pseudo OSX. So, it's worth noting that Raik's made a pretty
handy base for new themes.I recommend checking out both of them if this
doesn't do it for you (and it's rough around the edges, so it may not).

## Installation

### COMING SOON --- Using Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Nexus Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Nexus Theme package is listed as `Theme - Nexus` in the packages list.

### Using Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme/ "Theme - Nexus"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Nexus`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Nexus.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Settings

        "theme": "Nexus.sublime-theme"
    }

## Color Scheme

* `Nexus.tmTheme`

To use it simply select your Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Theme - Nexus -> Nexus.
